# RTGs
Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators for KSP!
http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?showtopic=155653
---------------------------------------------------
v. 0.6.0

Developed and tested for KSP 1.2.2

This mod adds a small collection of RTGs for Kerbal Space Program. They represent - as correctly as possible - their real counterparts in shape, weight, size; it is hard to convert the W of real life into the EC/s of KSP, and therefore the output power is kept equal to that of the stock PB-NUK RTG (80 EC/s). If desired, the config files can be edited to change this value.
MiniAVC (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745) is used in order to give KSP information about the currently installed version of the mod.

INSTALLATION:
Simply copy the RTGs folder in you KSP/GameData folder.

Currently available RTGs:

- MMRTG;
- GPHS;
- ASRG;
- MHW;

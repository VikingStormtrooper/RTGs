# RTGs
Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators for KSP!
---------------------------------------------------

This mod adds a small collection of RTGs for Kerbal Space Program. They represent - as correctly as possible - their real counterparts in shape, weight, size; it is hard to convert the W of real life into the EC/s of KSP, and therefore the output power is kept equal to that of the stock PB-NUK RTG (80 EC/s). If desidered, the config files can be edited to change this value.

Currently available RTGs:

- MMRTG.
